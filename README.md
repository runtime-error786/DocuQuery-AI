# DocuQuery-AI

This project provides a powerful system for querying large databases of documents. The system loads multiple documents, stores them in an AstraDB vector store, and enables users to ask queries. The queries are answered based on the most relevant information found within the stored documents. If the queried information is not found in the provided documents, the system will indicate that it does not have the answer.
